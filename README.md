This is the second project in TOP. The goal of this project is to create an 
entire webpage from a provided design. Since the first project, I have learned 
more about CSS in general and flexbox in particular.

After completing the project, I feel more confident in my ability to create a 
page from scratch using HTML and CSS. The few concepts that we had not covered 
in the course were easily searchable, and I found my ability to think of the 
page layout came easier after having done the flexbox exercises. While I am 
happy with the outcome, there are some topics that I want to learn more about.
What are common/best practices for naming classes? How and when to nest HTML 
elements? Responsive design practices for multiple devices and resizing windows (which is probably covered later in the course)?

Overall, this was a fun project that put a lot of skills to the test.
